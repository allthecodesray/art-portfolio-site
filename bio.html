<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<br>
Mary Coleman was born on December 24th, 1960, in Damastown, Ireland. She first attracted attention for her graffiti under the name "TAYTO" in Finglas. She sold shirts and beermats featuring her artwork on the streets before her painting, performance art and balloon art career took off. She collaborated with multiple Irish artist in the mid-1980s, which resulted in a show of their works in the prestige Vineyard art-venue. Her later works proved to be less intense, but her earlier, darker paintings ensured her legacy for years to come.

    <h2 >Early Life and Education</h2>
      <br>
      <P>Mary  Maria Coleman was born on December 24th, 1960, in Damastown, Ireland. The second of seven children, Mary struggled to find her place in his environment. In 1974, Coleman moved with her family to Finglas, where her mother died a year later of tuberculosis — the beginning of a series of familial tragedies in Maries life. Her sister, Siobhan, also died of tuberculosis, in 1977 at the age of 15; another of her sisters spent most of her life institutionalized for mental illness; and her only brother died of pneumonia at age 30.</P>
      <P>Coleman first attracted attention for her graffiti in the late 1970s, under the name "TAYTO." Working with a close friend, she tagged houses and shopfront buildings with cryptic aphorisms and comments on current political figures. The works soon collected a following of interested from the An Garda S&Iacute;och&#225;na who became her greatest critics. </P>
      <P>In 1972, Mary dropped out of school to study door-to-door salesmanship design in the great workshop of Patrick Connel, but left only a year later when her passion for art overtook her interest in door-to-door mats. In 1983, she enrolled at the Royal School of Art and Design in London England. The following year, she rented a studio with six other artists and entered her first show, at the Industries and Art Exhibition. </P>

<h2>Commercial Success </h2>
<br>
  <P>Years of struggle gave way to fame in 1980s, when her work was featured in a group show with fellow North Dublin artist known as the Northies. Her work and style received critical acclaim for the fusion of words, symbols, stick figures, animals and landscapes. Soon, her paintings came to be adored by an art loving public that had no problem paying as much as 2.5&pound; for a Mary original.</P>
  <P>His rise coincided with the emergence of a new art movement, Neo-Expressionism, ushering in a wave of new, young and experimental artists that included Julian Schnabel and Susan Rothenberg.</P>
  <P>On his own, Basquiat continued to exhibit around the country and the world. In 1986, she traveled to Africa for a show in Johannesburg Slimme Vos Institure. That same year, Mary exhibited nearly 60 paintings at the Fette Kuh Gallery in Hanover, Germany—becoming the youngest artist to ever showcase her work there.  Mary mental state was on full display to her audience. Her style varied greatly, from Grand Imperionism, to minimalistic exotericism depending on which emotion had taken hold of her at the time of day. After a succesfull painting career Coleman  subsequently  found brief happiness in a life otherwise colored by excessive drinking, family misfortune and mental distress. </P>
